  <font face="serif" size="4" color="black"> I'm Kirk Stanley Tan, I'm 15 years old and I am originally from <br>
  Tacloban, Leyte but I moved to Makati because of Typhoon Yolanda. I'm currently a Grade 10 Student in <br>
  Gen. Pio Del Pilar National High School. I like playing sports and video games, to be specific basketball <br>
  and matrial arts. I play any video game that makes me interest namely action or racing games whatever fits <br>
  my mood. I love playing with my friends, makes the experience better since I have someone to share it with. <br>
  I love music, I listen to it almost everytime since it makes me focus more on what I'm doing. My dream is <br>
  cloudy still, but I'm leaning more into feelance since I will have freedom on what I can do and choose. <br>
  Probably coding since I'm interested in it which makes it much easier to understand. I also look forward <br>
  to build my body through workouts and exercise, and also learn more martial arts. <br>
